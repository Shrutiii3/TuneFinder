# TuneFinder
## Overview 
This project involves creating a content-based song recommendation system using machine learning and Streamlit. The system suggests songs that are similar to a specified track by analyzing its artist, genre, album, and song title. Key components include data collection and preprocessing, feature engineering, model development using cosine similarity, and building an interactive web interface with Streamlit for real-time recommendations.
## Features
- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends songs by analyzing the input song's content and finding similar tracks.
- Streamlit Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface for inputting song details and viewing recommendations.
- Real-Time Recommendations: Instantly displays recommended songs based on the provided input.
- Data Handling: Efficient data processing and model optimization for high performance. 
## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- streamlit
