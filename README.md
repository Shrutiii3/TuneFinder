## Overview 
This project involves creating a content-based song recommendation system using machine learning and Streamlit. The system suggests songs that are similar to a specified track by analyzing its artist, genre, album, and song title. Key components include data collection and preprocessing, feature engineering, model development using cosine similarity, and building an interactive web interface with Streamlit for real-time recommendations.
